Given an array of integers, every element appears __three times__ except for one, which appears __exactly once__. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

__My Idea__

The description is quite short, but the problem behind this is a very classic problem. I have seen the same kind of problem before, and the difference is that that question's main element appears __two times__ and special number appears once. For that problem, the solution is quite simple, in which you only need to use XOR calculation to pile all numbers togeter on an integer, because same number doulbe XOR would recover original integer, and, at last, the speical number would remain on that integer.
```
int ret = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
	ret ^= nums[i];

return ret;
```

For this problem, we need to develop another method, but the core idea is also from the previous one. The reason we could use XOR operator to solve the previous question is that whenever a number appears twice the XOR would go wraparound to the original point, which means recover the original integer. What we need is a counter which could also restore the original status after seen k times any other number.
For this question, the majority number appears three times and the special number appears exactly once. 

In order to handle k = 3 times, we need, at least, 2-bit length integer counter (2^2 > 3), and consider each integer has 32-bit. Therefore, we need a 32*2 boolean(bit) array, or 2 Integers. (Here is trick), then we use XOR to simulate counter calculation.

```
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 1)
            return nums[0];
        int a = 0, b = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i ++)
        {
            a = a ^ (nums[i] & b);
            b = b ^ nums[i];
            int mask = ~(a & b);
            a = a & mask;
            b = b & mask;
        }
        return b;
    }
```
