In the computer world, use restricted resource you have to generate maximum benefit is what we always want to pursue.

For now, suppose you are a dominator of m 0s and n 1s respectively. On the other hand, there is an array with strings consisting of only 0s and 1s.

Now your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given m 0s and n 1s. Each 0 and 1 can be used at most __once__.

__Note:__
>1.The given numbers of 0s and 1s will both not exceed 100

>2.The size of given string array won't exceed 600.

Example 1:
```
Input: Array = {"10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"}, m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4

Explanation: This are totally 4 strings can be formed by the using of 5 0s and 3 1s, which are “10,”0001”,”1”,”0”
```
Example 2:
```
Input: Array = {"10", "0", "1"}, m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2

Explanation: You could form "10", but then you'd have nothing left. Better form "0" and "1".
```

__My Idea__

I would try greedy algorithm first if I'm not picking up this question from Dynamic Programing set. The ___Ones and Zeros___ name remindes me another classic dynamic programming question which is the first DP I met (0 1 bag). The difference is that we need to maintain a two-dimensions-map array, in which one dimension for keeping ___m___ state and another for  ___n___.

I didn't solve the algorithm question for a long while, so when the first time I was trying to design the program, I set the start point of map iterating at 0, which would cause a very bad error, because you would count yourself in predicting the optimized status.

__My Solution__
```
public class Solution {
    public int findMaxForm(String[] strs, int m, int n) {
        if((m == n && m == 0) || strs.length == 0)
            return 0;
        int[][] map = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        for(int k = 0; k < strs.length; k++){
            int elem_m = 0;
            int elem_n = 0;
            for(int q = 0; q < strs[k].length(); q++)
                if(strs[k].charAt(q) == '1')
                    elem_n ++;
                else if(strs[k].charAt(q) == '0')
                    elem_m ++;
            for(int i = m; i >=  0; i --)
                for(int j = n; j >= 0; j--)
                {
                    if(i - elem_m >= 0 && j - elem_n >= 0)
                        map[i][j] = Math.max(map[i - elem_m][j - elem_n] + 1, map[i][j]);
                }
        }
        return map[m][n];
        
    }
}
```
