Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

___Note: ___
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

___Follow up:___
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?


__My Idea__
My solution is a direct method, find the left tree nodes number N, if the N is greater then k, which means the Kth smallest node is in the left tree, if the N + 1 is equal to k, which means the current root node is our target, otherwise, if the N + 1 < k, which means the target is on the right tree. We recursively deploy this function until find the answer.


__My Solution__
    public int kthSmallest(TreeNode root, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        if(root.left != null)
            count = countNodes(root.left);
            
        if(count >= k)
            return kthSmallest(root.left, k);
        else if( k > count + 1)
            return kthSmallest(root.right, k - count - 1);
        return root.val;
    }
    
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root){
        if(root == null)
            return 0;
        else
            return 1 + countNodes(root.left) +  countNodes(root.right);
    }
