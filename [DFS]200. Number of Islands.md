##200. Number of Islands
__QUESTION__
--

Given a 2d grid map of **'1'**s (land) and **'0'**s (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

***Example 1:***

```
11110
11010
11000
00000
```

Answer: 1

***Example 2:***

```
11000
11000
00100
00011
```
Answer: 3

Very simple and straightforward question. You can mark start from the position that is **'1'**, and use DFS to mark all those **'0'** who located at top, left, right, down side, because they belong to single island.

```
public class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        if(grid.length == 0 || grid[0].length == 0)
            return 0;
        int ret = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < grid.length; i ++)
            for(int n = 0; n < grid[i].length; n ++)
            {
                
                if(grid[i][n] == '1')
                {
                    ret ++;
                    DFS_remove_island(grid, i, n);
                }
            }
        return ret;
    }
    
    public int DFS_remove_island(char[][] grid, int x, int y)
    {
        if(x >= 0 && y >=0 && x < grid.length && y < grid[0].length)
            if(grid[x][y] == '1')
            {
                grid[x][y] = '0';
                DFS_remove_island(grid, x - 1, y);
                DFS_remove_island(grid, x, y - 1);
                DFS_remove_island(grid, x, y + 1);
                DFS_remove_island(grid, x + 1, y);
            }
        return 0;
    }
}
