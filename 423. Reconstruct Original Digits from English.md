Given a __non-empty__ string containing an out-of-order English representation of digits 0-9, output the digits in ascending order.

__Note:__
>1.Input contains only lowercase English letters.

>2.Input is guaranteed to be valid and can be transformed to its original digits. That means invalid inputs such as "abc" or "zerone" are not permitted.

>3.Input length is less than 50,000.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: "owoztneoer"

Output: "012"
```
__Example 2:__
```
Input: "fviefuro"

Output: "45"
```


__My Idea__

This is an out-of-box idea, in which we are not only using pure programming algorithm, but also utilizing some outside observation. We find that __it is possible to predicate the count of numerical words by counting specific character in specific an order.__ 

>1.First of all, we find out those words who has unique character among all words (for example: for zero, we could get the count of ___zero___ by counting character __z__.), then we mark these words, remove them from list and give them an order that starts from zero. 

>2.Second, we find those words who has unique character among rest of words. In a same manner as first step, we record the character and the order that we pickup them up. __PLEASE KEEP IN MIND__, you need to make sure that you pick up a character that is not only unique among rest of words, but also unique among characters in the word which it belongs to. For example, I pick up the ___n___ for ___nine___, and there is an error which it always out double number of 9, because it treats each ___n___ as a ___nine___.

public class Solution {

        StringBuilder sret = new StringBuilder();
        char[] ca = s.toCharArray();
        int[] map = new int[26];
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
            map[(ca[i] - 'a')] ++;
        String[] sd = {"zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eigth", "nine"};
        char[] sign = {'z', 'o', 'w', 'r', 'u', 'f', 'x', 'v', 'g', 'i'};
        //int [] order ={  0,   7,   6,   2,   1,   3,   5,   4,   8,   9}
        int [] order = {0, 4, 5, 3, 7, 6, 2, 1, 8, 9};
        //int []order {  0,   1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6,   7,   8,   9}

        int[] ret = new int[10];

        for(int i: order)
        {
            ret[i] = map[sign[i] - 'a'];
            for(char c: sd[i].toCharArray())map[(c - 'a')] -= ret[i];
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i ++)
            for(int n = 0 ; n < ret[i] ; n++)
                sret.append(i);
        return sret.toString();
