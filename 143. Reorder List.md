Given a singly linked list L: L0→L1→…→Ln-1→Ln,
reorder it to: L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1→L2→Ln-2→…

You must do this in-place without altering the nodes' values.

For example,
Given {1,2,3,4}, reorder it to {1,4,2,3}.

__My Solution__

My first trial is to permutate the list, in which move the head item to the end of list.
```
For example:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

After first step, we have:

4, 5, 3, 6, 2, 7, 1
```
This is very close to the final answer, but we still need a inverse function.

```
After second step, we have:
1, 7, 2, 6, 3, 5, 4
```
However, this fucntion requires: first step O(n^2) +  second step O(n). This would trigger the __TLE__, so we need to find another way.
