129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
===
__QUESTION__
--
Given a binary tree containing digits from **0-9** only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path **1->2->3** which represents the number **123**.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

For example,

```
   1
  / \
 2   3
```

The root-to-leaf path **1->2** represents the number **12**.

The root-to-leaf path **1->3** represents the number **13**.

Return the **sum = 12 + 13 = 25**.

It is obvious that the question is related to the tree traverse. There are three types of traversing: **pre-order, in-order, post-order**. So, which one would be the best choice for the question?

The pre-order first access the parent then the children.

The in-order access the left child, then parent, then right child.

The post-order acess the children then parent.

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
```
Let's take a look this example, there are three leaf nodes, so we have three number: 124, 125, 13
The root node appears three times in the way of 100 (124), 100(125), 13(10), which means the root is considered in at least two different status, from perspective of his left-subtree, he is treated as 100, from his right-subtree, he is treated as 10. 
**It depends on the depth of leaf nodes.**

So, we have fist observation, if we access the parent before the children, if will be very complex. Therefore, bottom-up traverseing is required. This leaves us only one choice: **post-order traversing**

**Leaf-node**

The way that we handle leaf nodes is relatively easy, because we only need to sum it up to the result. What about the internal node?

**Internal-node**
The internal nodes including the root should be treated according to the leaves in their sub-tree. For example, the root 1 should multiply 100+ 100+ 10. **The difficulty is how to let the internal node know what role they would be played in the final result!**

The answer is in **the back tracking procedure**. Remember we are using post-order traversing, we could give the bottom internal nodes information from leaf nodes, and give the parent internal node from the internal node!

Let's design the program!

```
public class Solution {
    int result = 0;
    public int sumNumbers(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null)
            return 0;
        post_order_DFS(root);
        return result;
    }
    
    public int post_order_DFS(TreeNode tmp)
    {
        int left_ret = 0;
        int right_ret = 0;
        if(tmp.left != null)
            left_ret = post_order_DFS(tmp.left);
        if(tmp.right != null)
            right_ret = post_order_DFS(tmp.right);
        if(tmp.left == null && tmp.right == null)
        {
        	// leaf node 
            result += tmp.val;
            return 10;
        }
        else
        {
        	// internal node
            result +=(left_ret + right_ret) * tmp.val;
            return (left_ret + right_ret) * 10;
        }
    }
}
```
