134. GasStation
===

__QUESTION__
--

There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is ``gas[i]``.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs ``cost[i]`` of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.

There are two important thing you need to figure out before solving the problem:

1. The only thing that decides whether the car can traveral around is the fact that **total gas storage is larger than cost**. This satisfies the conservation of energy theory.
2. If point one is satisfied, our target is to find a point that allows us to start at there without running out the fuel during the traveling.

Now, we can start our journey. What's the logic? What the time complexity would be?
It is not difficult to see that the traversing will be performing in specific sequence. You can't jump from one point to anthor, and every node has there predecessor and successor. 

Another important message is that single traversing could reveal many important information: 

1. you may know whether or not the total gas is enough for traversing the entire route. 
2. you can know start from which node cannot reach the final destination. 
Well, now we split question into two different sub-objects: 1. You can traverse around or not; 2. What node can be seen as start point.

The question statement said there is only unique solution, so we don't need to be bothered because the duplicate problem.

**What would a node can't be start point?**

If we start from a node and find we stop in the middle of traveling due to running out the fuel, we can confidently say that this point can't be start point. What we gonna do next? start from the point next to the previous start point?

Answer is no, we can overlook the nodes before the start point, they can't be start point! The reason we can reach them **because we arrived at these nodes with at least zero or more gas in tank**. This is equal or better then we just start from them, but their gas storage donot allow us to keep traverling till the end, so they can't be start point! **So the start point must be in the nodes which next to the stop node!**

Ok, let's do the programming part!

```
public class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int length = gas.length;
        int start = 0;
        int remain = 0;
        int tank = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < length; i++)
        {
            tank = tank + gas[i] - cost[i];
            if(tank < 0)
            {   
                start = i + 1;
                remain = remain + tank;
                tank = 0;
            }
        }
        if(remain + tank < 0)
            return -1;
        else
            return start;
    }
}
```
