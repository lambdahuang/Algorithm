Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:

```
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```

__My Idea__

Using linear method without any optimization, it requires __O(n^3)__ to find the anwser, but we could optimize the algorithm and achieve the resuelt within __O(n^2)__. Sorting is always the source of the magic in searching problem. Let's go back and see this problem again, first of all, we could pick up the first number (let's denote A) and try to find rest of two (let's denote B,C), which satisfies the equation ``` B + C = A```. The ordinary method requires us to use another two loop to iterate all possible choices. However, it is not necessary, because B and C are actually interacted. In a non-decreasing array, we could put two pointer at the begining and the end of the array, we move left pointer forward 1 to right side if B+C is less then -A, and we move right pointer forward 1 to left side if B+C is greater then -A. We keep this procedure forwarding until two pointer are met. __This procedure would help us save an order of n complexity. __

It is important to remeber the borader problem. we don't wish to add duplicate item in the result, so we need to make sure that, in every movement, we could find a unique number, therefore, we could avoid the duplicate result.



__My Solution__

```
public List<List<Integer>> threeSum(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> ret = new LinkedList();
        if(nums.length < 3)
            return ret;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++)
        {
            if(i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1])
                continue;
            sum2(nums, ret, i);
        }
        return ret;
    }
    
    public int sum2(int[] nums, List<List<Integer>> ret, int target)
    {
        int left    = target + 1;
        int right   = nums.length - 1;
        while(left < right)
        {
            if(nums[left] + nums[right] == -nums[target])
            {
                List<Integer> tmp = new LinkedList();
                tmp.add(nums[target]);
                tmp.add(nums[left]);
                tmp.add(nums[right]);
                ret.add(tmp);
                while(left < nums.length - 1 && nums[left] == nums[++left]);
                while(right > target && nums[right] == nums[--right]);
                continue;
            }
            else if(nums[left] + nums[right] > -nums[target])
            {   
                while(right > target && nums[right] == nums[--right]);
                continue;
            }
            else
            {   
                while(left < nums.length - 1 && nums[left] == nums[++left]);
                continue;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
```
